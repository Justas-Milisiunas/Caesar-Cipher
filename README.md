# Caesar Cipher Algorithm

**Caesar cipher** is a an old way of transfering secret information back in medieval times.
The way it works is:
You have a text such as this:
"ABC"
and the cipher has a shift, for example +2.
Encrypted text will become:
"CDE"
If we decrypt, we get the same text as original.
"ABC"
